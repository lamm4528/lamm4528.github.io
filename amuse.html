<p>Vaping...it's not cool and not good for you. However, seeing someone who is old enough to be your grandpa rip a juul is <em>hilarious</em> please enjoy!</p>

<p>Facebook has alot of good "fake news" posts, but this website is literally fake news. Use this site to get laughs out of fooling your favorite aunt who maybe doesn't fact check everything she sees on her social feed.</p>
