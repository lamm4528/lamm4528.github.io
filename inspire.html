  <h2><strong>What defines a hero?</strong></h2>
  <p>A hero to me is someone that you can get guidence from, and learn from their truimphs. Heroes are role models that challenge us to be better individuals. Everyone has a hero, all for different reasons, but we all see a litte bit of us in our personal heros.
  <p>Resilience is an important characteristic to have when life's journey gets hard. Derrick Rose's resilience after he tore his acl after becoming the youngest MVP is a testament to how strong he is. Derrick was never the same player, he got traded from hometown team, bounced around the league has a bench player, and faced adversity. However, Derrick has always remained strong and committed to being the best him possible. This charcterisitic and his story fuels me to never give up on myself even when the world pushes me down.
